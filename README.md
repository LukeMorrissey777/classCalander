Web App to Add Classes Easily to Google Calander

This project is a web app that allows college users to enter their classes and will allow them to export those to their google calendar.

This is built using react for the frontend and django for the backend. I am currently working on implementing a feature to allow users to export their classes using a google calendar api.
